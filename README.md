# Deep Learning Project: 

***Image-Based Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation Using Deep Learning***

This project leverages the YOLOv8 deep learning model for image-based food recognition and calorie estimation. 
Using a dataset of high-quality, annotated food images, the model identifies various food items and estimates their nutritional information, including calorie content. 
The goal is to help users track their meals and make healthier dietary choices by providing quick and accurate nutritional assessments through image recognition. 
Future plans for the project include expanding features to provide personalized recipe recommendations based on dietary goals.

# Natural Language Processing Project: 

***Voice Verse â€“ Real-Time Cross-Lingual Text Translation for Gaming using NLP***

Voice Verse is a real-time cross-lingual NLP solution for a two-player gaming platform. 
This project utilizes the mBART-50 model to translate text messages across Indian languages, including Bengali, Assamese, and others, facilitating smooth communication between players of different linguistic backgrounds. 
Leveraging mBART-50 allows for high-quality translations across diverse languages with minimal fine-tuning, making it effective for low-resource language integration. 
This enhances accessibility, allowing players to interact seamlessly in their preferred language, enriching the gaming experience.
